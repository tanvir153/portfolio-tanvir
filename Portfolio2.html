                <h2>Md Tanvir Sardarr</h2>
                <p>
                    From my childhood, I was always mesmerized by how simple hi-tech appliances made our daily
                    activities smoother and efficient to carry on. Science of Computer has become a well-known subsets
                    & untapped area which is filled with the humongous potential to change the world. So, I was always
                    fascinated by this omnipresence of computer tools and gadgets as well as curious in exploring the
                    inner-workings of the daily appliances we use.<br> <br>

                    Therefore, I completed my High School & College education in science background. As an ardent
                    gaming fan and tech geek, I started learning coding first during 12th grade and leapt into the
                    world of computer programming. After finishing my college, I got an opportunity to study
                    Bachelor Degree in Software Engineering with a Chinese Local Govt Scholarship in China.
                    After that there has been no looking back till finishing my bachelor degree. After pursuing Bachelor
                    Degree, I aim to improve & strength my knowledge & strive to acquire the necessary skills of this
                    powerful blend of technology.<br> <br>

                    During my bachelor’s study, I have built several personal projects using
                    Python, Html, Java-Script, Java & their technologies like Django & MongoDB. Some of my
                    JavaScript projects are Weather App, Music Event App, Photo Details Display, A Shopping
                    Cart for Order Fulfilment. For graduation project I have built an Online Doctor Consultant
                    web app using Python & Django framework.<br> <br>

                    Although I don’t have any professional work experience yet but I always try to devote
                    myself to learn. As far as possible I like to do self-exploration and self-empowerment. My curiosity
                    to know about operations and applications led me obtain my bachelor degree with a CGPA of 3.50 out of 
                    4 with an excellent average score of 87.2%.<br> <br>

                    During this period, I also got an Out- Standing Student Award on 2019-2020 academic year
                    from Zhengzhou University. Besides I have completed HSK-5 which consider as the advance
                    Chinese Language level. <br><br>
                    I really enjoy reading Fiction books, especially those that are very imaginary. 
                    I do prefer to read computer magazines as I enjoy keeping up to date with new technology and gadgets.
